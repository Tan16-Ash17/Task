# Task
For this task, a specific data set was analyzed to identify the most sold products and the types of customers that purchase them. 

The most profitable products are Dorito Corn Chips Supreme (380g), Smiths Crinkle Chips Original Big Bag (380g), and Smiths Crinkle Chips Salt & Vinegar (330g). These items are large snack packets and fall into the junk food category. 

The most loyal customers are Young Singles/Couples, Retirees, and Older Singles/Couples. This indicates that singles and couples tend to buy large packets of snacks, while retirees also enjoy purchasing these larger sizes. Families and retirees often buy items in bulk to store for their household needs. 

In contrast, premium customers contribute more to the revenue through high-end product purchases, while budget buyers usually make smaller purchases, but at frequent intervals. Therefore, increasing advertising efforts targeted at budget buyers could encourage them to repeat their small transactions.
